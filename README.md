The more I work on assignments, it is starting to be more clear on how the database tables are created, models works and views interact 
with the controllers, etc. But, I am still not clear on what specific parts are handled by the MVC or the framework automatically and which
are not. I think this gap makes questions if i am not understadying completely or just know sure where some parts are coming from.
